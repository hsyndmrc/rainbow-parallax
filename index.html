          Rainbow Six Siege might be complicated to learn, but there are a few
          basics. To play Rainbow Six Siege, you must understand and follow
          them. Map knowledge: First, you must know the map you are playing in.
          It is very important to know the most primordial spots. Knowing them
          and being able to think before your opponent is crucial, especially in
          mid-round gunfights. Having a good game sense is important to play
          Siege, and that's obtained by spending time on the game's
          maps.Operator knowledge: Second, you must use your operators properly.
          Don't roam around the map if you are playing with an anchor — usually
          a three-armor, one-speed operator. If you are defending, place all
          your gadgets during the preparation phase, and help your teammates
          with reinforcements. In the case you are attacking, drone properly,
          and don't be afraid of using attacker repick.

          If you are starting to play Rainbow Six Siege, you must first complete
          the Situation missions. Then, you should get used to the game by going
          to Quick Match. Eventually, you should give Team Deathmatch a try.
          Team Deathmatch will be your best ally. This game mode lets you try
          out all the operators in the game regardless of having them locked. It
          will give you the opportunity to use almost every gun in the game, get
          used to the different recoils, and will make your map knowledge
          larger. The only downside is that you cannot use operator abilities.
          However, it's a great feature to improve and get better, especially in
          close-range gunfights.
